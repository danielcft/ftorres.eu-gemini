<h1>My tools of trade</h1>
<h2>Operative System</h2>
<p>I have been using Linux for more than 20 years. My favourite linux distribution is Debian. Reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's rock stable.</li>
  <li>All the pieces are put together as they should.</li>
  <li>Great community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people complain about Debian having outdated packages.</p>
<p>I am fine with not having the latest shiny new stuff.</p>
<h2>Window Manager - sway</h2>
<p>I honestly don't like the direction where most desktop environments are heading.</p>
<p>There seems to be a tendency on adding features and bloat.</p>
<p>Sway is a very lightweight window manager, which I found easy to use.</p>
<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>I use dirvish for my backups. Dirvish is just a small frontend on top of rsync.</p>
<p>Once a month, I attach an external hard drive and run a script that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mounts encrypted volume</li>
  <li>runs dirvish, which in turn will create a new folder in my external hardrive containing the latest backup</li>
</ul>
<p>This strategy allows me to stay in full control over the backup process, and it's fairly simple. It has proven to be effective over the years.</p>
<h2>Others</h2>
<p>My editor is neovim.</p>
<p>My email client is neomutt.</p>
<p>Hands down the best email client. Its painfully hard to setup, but once its configured to your tastes, its awesome. I use it in conjuction with other programs such as isync, not-much, abook, urlview.</p>
<p>When setting up mutt, I took many of the ideas from Luke Smiths' muttwizard</p>
<p>Favourite terminal utilities: fzf, ag, tmux</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>My personal laptop is a refurbished Thinkpad x230. This machine is very robust and is enough for my day to day computing needs</p>
<p>On my workplace I use a 16" 2019 Macbook pro.</p>
<p>Linux support for this machine is pretty limited, so I have to resort to use my debian in a VM. Despite being a workaround, the experience is quite OK.</p>
