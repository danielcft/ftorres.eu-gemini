# Using a dumbphone
I stopped using a smartphone. My current (dumb) phone is a nokia 800 tough.
This idea came up when I realized that I was spending a lot of time on the phone and not getting things done. 
So I got myself a dumbphone and disabled all data traffic. 

So far this is what I can share from the experience
Pros:
* Less distraction.
* Great battery life. I disabled all data communications other other than 2G. The battery lasts 2 weeks. You heard me right. TWO WEEKS! 
* More privacy. Honestly, in $CURRENT_YEAR tweaking a phone to be privacy preserving is like trying to make a car fly. It was not designed for that.
* Its somehow liberating to be less dependant on technology.

Cons:
* Since it does not run messaging apps, I am only able to comunicate via calls/SMS. Most of my friends/family use those apps. So I have to tell them to send me SMS instead.
* Forces me to plan things ahead. Things I would do adhoc such as looking for directions now have to be done beforehand and planned a bit. I am seriously considering buying a map of my city to help me with this.
* Some annoyances here and there. For instance the other day I went to a bar where they only had the menu as "QR CODE"

So far the pros outweight the cons. Lets see how long the experiment lasts.
