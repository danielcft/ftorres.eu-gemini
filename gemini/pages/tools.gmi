# My tools of trade

## Operative System
I have been using Linux for more than 20 years. My favourite linux distribution is Debian. Reasons:
* It's rock stable.
* All the pieces are put together as they should.
* Great community.

 Some people complain about Debian having outdated packages.
I am fine with not having the latest shiny new stuff.

## Window Manager - sway
I honestly don't like the direction where most desktop environments are heading. 
There seems to be a tendency on adding features and bloat.
Sway is a very lightweight window manager, which I found easy to use.

## Backups
I use dirvish for my backups. Dirvish is just a small frontend on top of rsync.

Once a month, I attach an external hard drive and run a script that:
* Mounts encrypted volume
* runs dirvish, which in turn will create a new folder in my external hardrive containing the latest backup

This strategy allows me to stay in full control over the backup process, and it's fairly simple. It has proven to be effective over the years.

## Others
My editor is neovim. 

My email client is neomutt.
Hands down the best email client. Its painfully hard to setup, but once its configured to your tastes, its awesome. I use it in conjuction with other programs such as isync, not-much, abook, urlview.

When setting up mutt, I took many of the ideas from Luke Smiths' muttwizard

Favourite terminal utilities: fzf, ag, tmux

## Hardware
My personal laptop is a refurbished Thinkpad x230. This machine is very robust and is enough for my day to day computing needs
On my workplace I use a 16" 2019 Macbook pro. 
Linux support for this machine is pretty limited, so I have to resort to use my debian in a VM. Despite being a workaround, the experience is quite OK.
