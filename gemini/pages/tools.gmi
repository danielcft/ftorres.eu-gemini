# Recommended Software

## Operative System
My favourite linux distribution is Debian. Reasons:
* It's rock stable.
* All the pieces are put together as they should.
* Great community.

## Window Manager
I honestly don't like the direction where most desktop environments are heading. There seems to be a tendency on adding features and bloat. i3 is a very lightweight window manager, which I found easy to use.

## Backups
rsync 

## Others
Vim for text editing, mutt for mail. Mutt can be painful to setup, but once its configured to your tastes, its awesome. I use it in conjuction with other programs such as isync, not-much, abook, urlview. When setting up mutt, I took many of the ideas from Luke Smiths' muttwizard

terminal utilities: fzf, ag, tmux

## Hardware
My personal laptop is a refurbished Thinkpad x230. This machine is very robust and is enough for my day to day computing needs
On my workplace I use a 16" 2019 Macbook pro. 
Linux support for this machine is pretty much non existent, so I have to make do with using debian in a virtual machine. Despite being a workaround, the experience is OK.
